=====

This is a super-simple game where you try to click only when the game tells you to click. If you don't start the click soon enough, or you continue holding down your click after you should stop, then you lose points.

I'm building this so I can talk with a friend about it, a friend who's a total programming beginner. In order to be prepared, I wrote this super simple game in two languages, Python and Javascript. For both implementations, I used only built-in libararies to build the user interface. For Python I used Tkinter, and for JS I used bare DOM access with no libaries.

By having a super-simple game to talk about, and having it in two different languages, I hope it'll improve our conversations about programming basics.
